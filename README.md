Abstractâ€” Inter Process Communication through shared memory is a concept where two or more process can access the common memory and communication is done via this shared memory where changes made by one process can be viewed by another process. Each process has its own address space; if any process wants to communicate with some information from its own address space to other processes, then it is only possible with inter-process communication techniques. Whereas ,shared memory is the fastest inter-process communication mechanism. The operating system maps a memory segment in the address space of several processes to read and write in that memory segment without calling operating system functions.  shared memory segment is a portion of physical memory that is shared by multiple processes. In this region, processes can set up structures, and others may read/write on them. When a shared memory region is established in two or more processes, there is no guarantee that the regions will be placed at the same base address. The goalof this collaborative system is to provide a convenient environment for participants to interact with each other and support collaborative applications such as instant messaging, distance learning and conferencing.
